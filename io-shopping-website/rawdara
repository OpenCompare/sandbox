The more you learn about it, the more beautiful it becomes. Sure, MacBook Air is unbelievably thin and light. But we also designed it to be powerful, capable, durable, and enjoyable to use, with enough battery life to get you through the day. That's the difference between a notebook that's simply thin and light and one that's so much more. Thin, light, durable. Thank you, flash storage. Even at less than an inch thin, MacBook Air sets a pretty high standard - by making flash storage standard. Flash chips are very compact, allowing MacBook Air to be incredibly thin and light. Flash is also solid state, meaning there are no moving parts. Which makes it reliable, durable, and quiet. And it takes up much less space - about 90 percent less, in fact. That creates room for other important things, like a bigger battery. So you have a notebook that weighs almost nothing and runs for hours on a single charge. That's mobility mastered.

The Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series switches is a line of fixed configuration, enterprise-class, IEEE 802.3af and Cisco prestandard Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches in Fast Ethernet configurations that provide availability, security, and quality of service (QoS) to enhance network operations. The Catalyst 3560 is an ideal access layer switch for small enterprise wiring closets or branch office environments that are using their LAN infrastructure for the deployment of new products and applications such as IP telephones, wireless access points, video surveillance, building management systems, and remote video kiosks. Customers can deploy network-wide intelligent services, such as advanced QoS, rate limiting, access control lists, multicast management, and high-performance IP routing - while maintaining the simplicity of traditional LAN switching. Embedded in the Catalyst 3560 is the Cisco Cluster Management Suite (CMS) Software, which allows users to simultaneously configure and troubleshoot multiple Cisco Catalyst desktop switches using a standard Web browser. Cisco CMS Software provides configuration wizards that greatly simplify the implementation of converged networks and intelligent network services.The Catalyst 3560 Series can provide a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for deployments that incorporate Cisco IP phones and Cisco Aironet wireless LAN access points, as well as any IEEE 802.3af-compliant end device. Power over Ethernet removes the need for wall power to each PoE-enabled device and eliminates the cost for additional electrical cabling that would otherwise be necessary in IP phone and wireless LAN deployments. Maximum power availability for a converged voice and data network is attainable when a Catalyst 3560 Switch is combined with the Cisco Redundant Power System 675 (RPS 675) for seamless protection against internal power supply failures and an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system to safeguard against power outages.

    Product: Cisco  Catalyst (WSC356024PSS) 24-Ports Rack-Mountable Switch Managed ($170.0-$2210.0)
The Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series switches is a line of fixed configuration, enterprise-class, IEEE 802.3af and Cisco prestandard Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches in Fast Ethernet configurations that provide availability, security, and quality of service (QoS) to enhance network operations. The Catalyst 3560 is an ideal access layer switch for small enterprise wiring closets or branch office environments that are using their LAN infrastructure for the deployment of new products and applications such as IP telephones, wireless access points, video surveillance, building management systems, and remote video kiosks. Customers can deploy network-wide intelligent services, such as advanced QoS, rate limiting, access control lists, multicast management, and high-performance IP routing - while maintaining the simplicity of traditional LAN switching. Embedded in the Catalyst 3560 is the Cisco Cluster Management Suite (CMS) Software, which allows users to simultaneously configure and troubleshoot multiple Cisco Catalyst desktop switches using a standard Web browser. Cisco CMS Software provides configuration wizards that greatly simplify the implementation of converged networks and intelligent network services.The Catalyst 3560 Series can provide a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for deployments that incorporate Cisco IP phones and Cisco Aironet wireless LAN access points, as well as any IEEE 802.3af-compliant end device. Power over Ethernet removes the need for wall power to each PoE-enabled device and eliminates the cost for additional electrical cabling that would otherwise be necessary in IP phone and wireless LAN deployments. Maximum power availability for a converged voice and data network is attainable when a Catalyst 3560 Switch is combined with the Cisco Redundant Power System 675 (RPS 675) for seamless protection against internal power supply failures and an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system to safeguard against power outages.

    Product: CableWholesalecom - Bulk cable 305 m fiber optic 62.5 / 125 micron plenum ($214.95-$214.95)
This is a orange bulk 1000 foot spool of Plenum Zipcord fiber optic cable intended for large installations where you are completing the terminations. It is a multimode fiber (62.5 micron core) designed to transmit data across shorter distances at LAN speeds. Multimode fiber is optimized to work with fiber optic equipment using light wave lengths of 850nm (nanometers) or 1300nm. The cord is duplex (two fibers) which means it permits synchronous communication between devices. The cladding diameter is 125 microns. The Graded-Step core and cladding of our orange bulk 62.5/125 fiber optic cable is constructed using a high quality multimode fiber that is compliant with TIA/EIA 492AAAA-A, IEC 60793-2-10 and ISO/IEC 111801 (type OM1 fiber). This particular cable is Plenum Rated. Plenum spaces are the area between floors or above office areas for heating/cooling airflow. If an office were to catch fire, this plenum area could easily allow the spread of the fire to more floors or across the entire building. Plenum rated cables are jacketed with a fire-retardant plastic jacket of either a low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or a fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) for less toxicity during a fire. - Plenum Zipcord Fiber Optic Cable, Multimode, Duplex, 62.

LTO-Ultrium Universal Cleaning Cartridge is compatible with all manufacturers' LTO Ultrium 1, 2, 3 and 4 drives and provides up to 50 cleanings or as many as your particular drive allows. Cleaning is done by shuffling a specific amount of tape over the drive head based on a specific cleaning algorithm that is unique to each drive manufacturer. Cleaning reduces built-up or stains that get deposited on drive heads and should be done whenever the drive's use cleaning cartridge signal is flashing. It is recommended that you keep track of the number of times you use the cartridge and discard it after it reaches the maximum number of uses for your drive model. In addition, the cartridge has an RF (radio frequency) LTO-CM (cartridge memory) that keeps track of the number of times your cartridge has been used. Most drives will read the CM, see when your drive has been used the maximum number of times, and will no longer use that cleaning cartridge.

    Product: Tamron SP A011 150-600 mm F/5-6.3 VC Di USD Lens For Nikon ($1069.0-$1499.0)
The Tamron SP 150-600MM F/5-6.3 DI VC USD (MODEL A011) Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens features VC (Vibration Compensation) image stabilization, speedy, precise USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) , state-of-the-art eBAND (Extended Bandwidth Angular-Dependency) Coating, which significantly reduces the unwanted light reflections that cause flare and ghosting, and a sophisticated and stylish new external finish. Its 4x ultra-telephoto zoom capabilities, with a focal length range from 150mm to 600mm, enhance the creative potential of telephoto photography, a captivating feature for all photographers, particularly nature, wildlife, and sports shooters. 4x ultra-telephoto zoom lens with a focal length range of 150mm to 600mm The focal length range of this lens was extended by 50mm on the wide-angle side and 100mm on the telephoto side compared to the existing model A08, making it possible to take even more striking photographs of birds, wildlife, sports, and other distant subjects. Mounted on APS-C DSLR cameras, it has a stunning near1000mm telephoto equivalent focal length range of 233mm to 930mm. World class image quality Employing 20 elements in 13 groups and boasting an advanced optical design, the lens delivers a superior balance of resolution and contrast for sharp, clear images. The front group contains three LD (Low Dispersion) glass elements (two in the first group, one in the third) for enhanced optical correction effectiveness, enabling the lens to thoroughly compensate for on-axis aberrations at the telephoto end. The lens also adopts eBAND Coating, developed from state-of-the-art coating technologies, and conventional BBAR (Broad-Band Anti-Reflection) Coating to greatly suppress ghosting and flare even when shooting under adverse lighting conditions. Achieves a 600mm focal length in a compact easy-to-handle package Ingenious optical design features minimize the movement of lens groups within the lens when zooming. This reduces the amount of barrel extension needed to cover the complete focusing range, making the entire lens more compact. Beautiful background blur effects Adopting a 9 blade circular diaphragm enables users to create beautiful background blur effects (Bokeh), which provide even greater potential for creative expression. This circular diaphragm retains a nearly circular shape even at two stops down from its maximum aperture. VC (Vibration Compensation) mechanism creates greater opportunities for sharper handheld photography Tamron's proprietary VC (Vibration Compensation) image stabilization system uses a three-coil system, delivering significantly sharper images and creating greater opportunities for handheld ultra-telephoto photography. Comfortable autofocus Tamron's SP 150-600mm F/5-6.3 Di VC USD features a USD (Ultrasonic Silent Drive) ultrasonic motor drive for swift and accurate AF response, it delivers high torque, very fast response times, and very low noise. The full-time manual focus mechanism allows users to make fine manual focus adjustments at any time even when AF is engaged. Elegant, high-class external finish Tamron has upgraded the cosmetic design and finish of this lens to create a more sophisticated, high-end look in keeping with the demands of discerning full-frame DSLR users. Employing a sophisticated linear pattern rubber grip on the zoom and focus rings and an attractive and stylish tungsten silver brand ring, this newly designed model accentuates its visceral presence with understated elegance and class.

The Canon L II USM 24 mm is a good choice for photographers who want both a wide aperture and auto-focusing ability in a wide-angle camera lens. The f/1.4 aperture — the widest on any current Canon lens — is fast and quiet due to the high-speed CPU used in the Ring USM (Ultrasonic Motor) auto-focusing system. Manual focusing is also available at any time. The Canon L II USM is a high-performance lens for people who want professional results and images of the highest quality. It is a prime Canon camera lens compatible with all Canon cameras with the EF mounting. Ultra-low Dispersion glass elements in the lens help reduce chromatic aberrations, while Canon’s Subwavelength Structure Coating is applied to the inside surface of the lens to minimize flare and ghosting. This Canon camera lens is also constructed with Super Spectra coating for additional resistance to internal reflections. These special coatings combine to protect against light pollution and make sure any image captured is as clear as possible. Though the Canon L II USM is a sealed lens and is both dust and weather-proof, it requires a filter for complete sealing. This lens might be a good choice for those looking for a sharp and fast wide-angle camera lens that can produce quality images while providing the convenience of auto-focusing.

    Product: Bazooka BTA6100 1-Way 6" Car Subwoofer ($199.99-$199.99)
As all in one solutions go, you simply can't beat the A100 Amplified Bass Tubes by Bazooka. Designed to be a simple-to-install, yet effective upgrade to your car's existing mobile audio system, the A100 Bass Tubes feature a 100 watt, 2-channel amplifier built right in, coupled to a dual voice coil woofer. Since the amplifier has a built in crossover to remove the high frequencies the woofer cannot play from the signal, you get exactly what you need in the A100's - crisp, clean bass and nothing more. When connected to your system, the end result is seamless integration, both electrically and audibly, yielding sound quality your factory auto sound system simply can't touch. The BTA6100 features a 6 inch dual voice coil subwoofer, and fits in places most subs can't. The 6 inch works great behind the seat of small trucks, the trunks of sedans or hatchbacks. Simply point it into the rear corner to take advantage of the Bass Tubes Enclosure, and you're rocking in no time.

    Product: Yamaha CD-S2000 CD Changer ($1999.99-$1999.99)
The CD-S2000 player whisper quite loading drawer mechanism transports CDs and super audio CDs smoothly on to the drive screw of the brushless motor. It almost goes without saying that the loading drawer is made of robust aluminum rather than plastic material. Separate power packs for analog and digital modules eliminate the last possible sources of interference. And anyone who can do without a track display switches off the display and the digital outputs completely with the pure-direct switch, already renowned from Yamaha re-ceivers. This leaves nothing to distract from the actual enjoyment of the music. The sound is as fascinating as it always was - just even more beautiful.

    Product: Sony HT-ST7 Sound Bar / Wireless Subwoofer ($1148.0-$1299.99)
Marvel in true 7.1 surround sound from seven amplifiers and nine speakers in a single bar design that's redefining what a sound bar can be. Designed with the help of award-winning Hollywood sound engineers, this 450-watt system delivers full-range, Dolby TrueHD sound with the plug-and play simplicity of 3 HDMI inputs, plus Bluetooth audio for one-touch audio streaming from your Android or IOS mobile device. No other sound bar even comes close. Engulf yourself in an immersive 7.1 channel sound experience With 9-individual speaker drivers, including integrated front and center channels plus dedicated tweeters, all powered by 7-discrete digital amplifiers, the ST7 delivers a great, balanced, detailed sound. The ST7 hits the acoustic sweet spot for everyone in the audience providing for a perfect listening experience, while the surround sound works its way seamlessly around you and your home. 3 HDMI connections Get superior high-definition picture and sound quality from up to three high-definition source devices (ex. Cable box, Blu-ray player, gaming console, etc), all of which can be conveniently plugged in ST7. Connect stream music from Bluetooth devices with just one-touch The easiest and fastest way to start streaming music from your NFC enabled device to your home theater system. Near Field Communication lets you connect and wirelessly stream music from your smartphone or tablet by touching them together just once. No NFC, no problem. Thanks to Bluetooth, you can still connect and stream music from your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Any time, any place Hear your sound instead of seeing it. The wireless sub-woofer delivers incredible heart pounding bass, and, because it's wireless, it can be placed anywhere in the room. The wireless subwoofer is also front-firing, so it compliments the bar for a seamless sound, while the down-firing passive radiator subwoofer helps deliver a bold and powerful low-frequency range. True Theater Sound Since movies are created with detailed soundtracks, shouldn't your sound bar be able to represent them the way they were created to sound? Working with award winning sound engineers for Sony Pictures Entertainment, we were able to design the ST7 to more faithfully represent the sound characteristics you would hear in a theater. Experience movies as the directors intended them to sound with Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio code support. You're Surrounded Experience room filling cinematic simulated surround sound with Sony's S-Force Front Surround sound technology. The ST7 delivers a powerful surround sound effect without the need to connect multiple speakers throughout the room. Additional Features: Magnetic Fluid Speaker technology In conventional speakers, dampers provide suspension and stability for voice coils, which unfortunately create unwanted noise and distortion. By eliminating speaker dampers and replacing them with magnetic fluid speaker technology, energy efficiency is dramatically improved, and mids and highs are extended in incredible detail and clarity, for a more accurate revealing sound, in addition to cranking out 1.6 times the volume of a conventional speaker.

The Kestrel 1000 is the one that started it all! We developed the Kestrel 1000 Pocket Wind Meter in 1995 when NK co-owner Richard Kellerman needed a reliable wind meter for flying his glider. If necessity is the mother of invention, then quality is the secret to aging gracefully. 14 years later, the Kestrel 1000 looks a little slicker, but still gives reliable, accurate wind measurements that you need.

Desire by Dolce&Gabbana crowns The One fragrance chapter with an expression of the essence of the Dolce&Gabbana woman in scent.Everything starts with desire. There wouldnÆt be seduction, sensuality or passion if it wasnÆt for desire. For us, itÆs always been fundamental to let this sensation go, to break the mould and live freely by emotions. Desire by Dolce&Gabbana is an Oriental Floral that completes The One collection with a bouquet of intense and intoxicating notes to create an opulent and deeply feminine fragrance. TOP: Fresh top notes of mandarin, lychee and bergamot play softly against the sweet innocence of lily of the valley. HEART: At the core of an intense heart is a trio of ultra feminine florals. The elegance of Madonna lily and the heady opulence of Indian tuberose are blended with velvety jasmine and addictively sweet plum nectar. BASE: Adding an indulgent richness to the base is a gourmand note of vanilla infused caramel, melded with warming sandalwood and a touch of mysterious musk and Cistus Labdanum.

Six-inch insulated flex duct connects the Make-Up Air Control to a screened, fresh air inlet mounted on the outside of the home. When the furnace blower operates, the damper in the Make-Up Air Control opens, automatically pulling outside air into the furnace. The air is cleaned by the filters, heated or cooled, and circulated through the duct system. As a result, a slight pressure builds up in the home, preventing unwanted air infiltration around windows and doors.

    Product: man's Own Organics Pretzel Rounds Unsalted -- 8 oz ($2.91-$45.45)
Newman's Own Organics - Organic Pretzel Unsalted Rounds - 8 oz. (226.8g)Newman's Own Organics Organic Pretzel Unsalted Rounds are clever looking little pretzels, aren't they? Yes, and they taste great, too. Pretzels were always Dad's favorite snack. That's why they started the company with them, says Nell. It's amazing that pretzels have been around for over thirteen hundred years; maybe it's because they are so versatile. Many recipes can be found in cookbooks or on-line that use them. They can be crushed for a pie base, eaten with dips of all kinds, added to nuts, dried fruit and cereal for homemade trail mix, coated in melted chocolate (fun to do with kids), or just a quick, healthy snack.They have a perfect pretzel for every occasion. In fact they have ten varieties to choose from. And since they're baked (not fried), their pretzels make a great low-fat, healthy snack with only 1 to 1.5 gram fat (no trans-fat). The Rounds come in Salted and Unsalted, and the Minis include Spelt, High Protein, Honey Wheat and the Mighty. Spelt has a light, slightly sweet, nutty flavor. With a stronger outer hull than either oats or wheat it seems to keep more of the nutty grain taste and good nutrients locked inside. By using yellow pea flour in their High Protein,Â they were able to create a pretzel with 5 grams of protein per serving. Sticks are available in Salted, Thin and for those who have requested a thicker stick, Rods. Their old style pretzel rods forced us to revise an old adage: Don't spare the rods. Spoil the child! Their pretzels are all certified organic by Oregon Tilth. Good FoodThat's what they kept in mind when they created their products. they focus on the kinds of products they loved as kids, but take them one step further by using the highest quality of available organic ingredients. They find that people really want to know how the ingredients are grown and processed on the way to their grocer's shelf.

    Product: Volpaia Classico Riserva ($25.99-$36.69)
This wine is from Italy, Tuscany region, Chianti Classico sub-region. Castello di Volpaia overlooks the village of Radda in Chianti. The town was built in the 11th century as a fortified village on the border of Florence and Sienna. Although only part of the original protective walls and two of its six towers are still standing, the medieval layout and buildings within the village are still intact, making Volpaia one of the best preserved villages of its period. Just as it has been for the last 900 years, the entire village is intimately involved in the production of wine and olive oil. The cellars, bottling plant, barrels and olive press are nestled within the original stone walls that have been carefully restored by owners Carlo Mascheroni and Giovanella Stianti Mascheroni and their children, Nicolo and Federica. The nearly 114 acres of vineyards owned by Castello di Volpaia are at 1,300-2,130 feet above sea level, making Volpaia the highest winery in the Chianti region. The land is comprised of soils consisting largely of sandstone and a sedimentary rock from the Pliocene era. Volpaia is certified organic and biodynamic in all of its vineyards.
    Product: Tenute Silvio Nardi Brunello Di Montalcino 2006 750ml Sangiovese Red Wine ($50.99-$93.99)
The delicate pink juice of the tiny, nearly black-skinned Brunello grape yields a dark, purple-red wine which is characterized by extraordinary concentration, elevated acidity and enormous tannic extract. The wine is typically closed and quite austere when young, often backward and unapproachable. Generally considered to be young at ten years in an average vintage, Brunello di Montalcino’s proponents contend that the best vintages can easily surpass a century and still remain in their prime.

    Product: Air-O-Swiss AOS 7142 1.98 Gallon Humidifier ($199.99-$199.99)
This efficient Air-O-Swiss Ultrasonic humidifiier uses several cutting edge technologies to achieve an optimum quality of environmental control.

The water is kept clean with three separate processes that make up the Microbial Protection System: ultrasonic technology, pre-heating, and Ionic Silver Stick. The latter makes use of the proven anti-microbial qualities of Silver, which has proven effective against more than 650 types of bacteria without any chemical additives.

    Product: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare -- Reflex Edition  (Wii, 2009) ($12.99-$47.99)
Infinity Ward's critically acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare comes to the Wii thanks to the efforts of Treyarch, known for its slightly less polished, if still highly competent, contributions to Activision's hugely popular franchise. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare -- Reflex Edition eschews the traditional WWII setting that had been the hallmark of the series, instead taking on the more nebulous world of modern warfare. Nazi storm troopers and kamikaze pilots have been replaced by a patchwork group of terrorists and insurgents, and traditional WWII weapons have been jettisoned in favor of more than 70 modern armaments. Though the story is a departure from the previous games, Modern Warfare -- Reflex still features intense mission-based first-person shooter gameplay that should be familiar to fans.<br><br>The plot centers on two megalomaniacal madmen who are fomenting unrest around the world in an attempt to cement their own power. Imran Zakhaev is a one-armed Russia nationalist who longs to return his country to a Soviet Union style of government by seizing a stockpile of nuclear weapons. Zakhaev has support from several divisions of the Russian army, but, knowing that the United States would quickly come to the aid of the Russian government, he funds a coup in the Middle East to divert attention. Led by Zakhaev ally Khaled Al-Asad, the Middle Eastern coup results in intense fighting which eventually leads to the launch of a Russian nuclear missile toward American soil. Players fight through this chaos as both Sergeant John MacTavish, a British SAS operative doing battle in Russia, and Sergeant Paul Jackson, a U.S. Marine fighting in the Middle East.<br><br>Modern Warfare -- Reflex Edition aims to capture the challenges of modern war by pitting the superior technology of the U.S Marines and British SAS against the cunning guerilla tactics of a terrorist group. In addition to close quarters combat, players will be called upon to perform fast-rope helicopter drops, provide air support from an AH-1 Super Cobra helicopter, call in precision air strikes, and man the turret of an AC-130 Spectre Gunship to engage enemy fighters from the sky. Gamers also join a two man sniper team on a flashback mission in which players head to the Chernobyl Zone of Alienation on a mission to assassinate a younger Zakhaev.<br><br>The Wii version of the game lets two players join forces to take on the main campaign, but it otherwise features the same expansive set of online multiplayer modes as its console cousins. Players will be able to choose from Assault, Special Ops, Light Machine Gunner, Demolitions, and Sniper classes, or create up to five special classes with customizable weapons and perks. Gamers can then take their fighters through a dozen different multiplayer modes like Free-for-All, Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy, Headquarters, Domination, and Sabotage. Players who frequently battle online will be able to accrue experience points, unlock special weapons and gear, and eventually unlock Prestige Mode in which gamers can trade in their rank for special insignias.
